# Wood Heart
Our project entails the development of a comprehensive furniture retail website, where users have the opportunity to register on the platform. Once registered, users can browse through an extensive catalog of furniture products and add desired items to their shopping cart. The website facilitates secure transactions, allowing users to make purchases and acquire the selected furniture items. Additionally, there is a dedicated section for users to provide their valuable opinions and reviews on the various furniture products available. This project was undertaken as a collaborative effort within a limited time frame, spanning a duration of five days.
